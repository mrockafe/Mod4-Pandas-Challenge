Module 4 Challenge using Pandas

# Please view this read me in code view

In this repository is all requested files needed to complete are contained within. 
This read me will elaborate where each file is and what it is for.
The main repository contains 2 folders, a docx file, an ipynb file, and this read me. 

Module 4_Pandas Challenge Analysis is a word document containing how I created my step by step code and then my findings t the bottom of the document. 

PyCitySchools_Example.ipynb is untouched starter code with diagrams for comparision purposes only, not editing or to run.

The Images folder can be ignored for this module as no dataframes or graphs were required to be captured and saved. 

PyCitySchools folder will be the main bulk of the work for this module. Inside it contains a resources folder and another ipynb file
  The Reasources folder will contain both the schools.csv file and students.csv that house the data we read into our code for analysis
  The PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb is the main code for this project
     The paths are set relative so a colne of this repository will properly allow any user to run this code
     This code is set to run on jupyter lab
     Any questions on how the code was written should be explained in the written analysis listed prior
